# HorseRace

Tis Android app generates a "horse race" between a number of progress bars (the user can choose 2 to 20 "horses").

This is a very simple Android app to show how multithreading works. It uses ASyncTask (which is deprecated since API level 30), so it should only serve as an example and not as guidance on how to implement multithreading in your own professional app.

This app is used in the course "Mobile Development". I plan to rewrite it to remove ASyncTask.
